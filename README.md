# Android-Email-App-using-Javamail-Api  
An Android App to send mail without gamil/email interaction!  
The demo video of the app is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTLDsFXLb4)  
I haven't used the default Android Email Client to send emails instead used Javamail API to create my own email sender. And you can also use this App for Email.  
NOTE: Edit the Config.java file to update your gmail account and password.  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..   
Happy Coding :)
